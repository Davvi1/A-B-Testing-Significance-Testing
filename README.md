# ðŸ§  A/B Testing Portfolio: Combined Projects from Turing College
Welcome! This repository showcases three integrated projects developed during my studies at Turing College. Each project reflects a learning curve, with subsequent projects having received feedback from a mentorship team of employees from Google, IBM, Meta, and more top engineering companies. Each project reflects a distinct aspect of my data science skillset, including:

ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Manipulation

ðŸ“Š Exploratory & Statistical Analysis

ðŸ§ª A/B Testing & Significance Testing

Across the combined work, I use Python, SQL, and a variety of A/B testing and analysis libraries to deliver insights and build a cohesive data report. The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate not only technical skills but also my ability to structure and communicate findings effectively.
